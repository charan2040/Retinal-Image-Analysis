# Retinal Image Analysis for Diabetic Retinopathy Detection 🧠📊

A deep learning-based solution for early-stage detection of diabetic retinopathy using CNN and transfer learning techniques.

## 🚀 Overview

This project focuses on analyzing large-scale retinal datasets and detecting the severity of diabetic retinopathy through deep learning models. The pipeline is built using PyTorch Lightning and integrates preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

## 🛠 Features

- Efficient data preprocessing (cropping, resizing, cleaning)
- CNN architecture fine-tuned with transfer learning
- Training metrics tracked via TensorBoard
- Inference via a simple Gradio web interface
- Supports real-time image prediction

## 📂 Dataset

- Kaggle Diabetic Retinopathy Detection: https://www.kaggle.com/c/diabetic-retinopathy-detection

## 📦 Installation
